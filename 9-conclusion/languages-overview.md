# C, C#, C++, Java

## C (1973, Dennis Ritchie)
- based on functions
- does not use classes
- even faster than C++ bc OOP adds overhead to language
- Apps: used esp for low-level programs like device drivers

## C++ (1979, Bjarne Stroustrup)
- added classes to C (made C OO)
- fast and can access all facilities of hardware
- can generally compile C programs using a C++ compiler

## Java (1995, Sun Microsystems (now Oracle))
- added virtual machine
- strongly based on C++
- People thought C++ was 
	- too hard
	- too prone to bugs 
	- needed to be recompiled to binary format  for every new platform it was run on
- Java: 
	- run on Java virtual machine -> don't need to recompile per
	- VM helps check for bugs (garbage collector checks you've  deallocated memory)
	- but VM means Java runs more slowly than C++

## C# (2000, Anders Hejlsberg for Microsoft)
- also uses a VM 
- slower than C++
- with .NET, for Windows and some websites

## Objective C (1980s, Brad Cox and Tom Love for Apple)
- based on C++
- uses lightweight VM
- associated with Apple
